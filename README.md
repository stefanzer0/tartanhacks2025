Welcome to OSINTly!

As Heinz College students at CMU, we wished to apply our degree program skills towards real-world applications of information security.
In an effort to assist people who are unaware of their digital footprint online, we built a web application that can detect and scour the Internet for traces of personally identifying information.
Using user-supplied fields such as email handle, known IP addresses, social media usernames, and phone numbers, users are able to obtain a comprehensive report of their Internet presence from multiple available public search sources.

To some, the amount of information truly out there may surprise them! Don't hesitate to find your digital footprint today!

P.S. Gemini 2.0 API integration allows for useful instructions towards the remediation of your harmful online presence habits.

Technical Implementation:
Microsoft Windows Server 2025 IIS hosts/serves the web content.
Python 3.11.9 backend process listens for requests from submitted forms in the web app.
After supplying the backend calls with the requested information, the front end is automatically populated with results.
